"*SCRUM* is a technique to develop products with the objective of maximising product and project value."
-- SCRUM

[.cue]
****
SCRUM definition refers to an agile technique to *maximise the product and projetct value*. SCRUM starts with 
those aspects that we know or we have seen. After that, we adpat and track the progress as necessary 
(Iterativelly). 

Principal advantages of implementing SCRUM could be sumarising as: 

- *Decrement of the development time:* Products that satisfies with most of the decided 
functionalities and expetance.
- *Anytime a product could be launch*: Functional prototypes will enable to launch a product at the end of 
each sprint (project stage). 
- *Agility and Flexibility:* Adaptability to the newer requirements and demanded modifications.

SCRUM methodology will start with the interviews between the customers and the product owner (client voice in 
our company). Resulting from these interviews, the product owner elaborates an initial  *Product Backlog*. 
The product backlog list of the main functionalities of the applicaiton that could change over time (sprints). 
From product-backlog and in each sprint, the development team schedule the number of commits and functionalities 
they will develop (*sprint planning meeting*). As a result from the sprint planning, the sprint backlog will stores
the numer of issues and the time required for elaborating them. At this moment, the sprint starts and the development
team is focused on performing the functional prototype. In this stage, the SCRUM master is the person in charge of 
revising the work and ensuring correct developemnt times according to the plan. Each day of the sprint, the 
*daily scrum meetings* ensures to avoid bottlenecks and problems during the development. These meetings corresponds 
to small meetings where main problems and issues are discussed. At the end of the sprint, a *review* of the product
functionalities with the client is performed. In this meeting, the functionalities are validated and newer 
requirements could appear. Finally, the development team and the scrum-master elaborates an *sprint review* just to 
evaluate the sprint and how we could improve for the next one.

Within the next slides, we will enter in depth to this process describing the team members and roles, the artifacts
(documents to be elaborated), and the meetings to be performed.

== Product Backlog

[.cue]
****
The main parts of the SCRUM technique is the product backlog which defines requirements 
the application must meet in order to be successful. The product backlog contains a list of 
requirements that are jointly prepared between the client and the product owner. Commonly, the requirements 
are expressed in form of user stories. 
****

[.slide-title-top]
== User Stories
image::user-story.jpeg[User Story,1280,720,role=cover canvas]

[.cue]
****
User stories (or just “stories”) are short statements identifying the type of person, 
the functionality they need to perform in their own terms, and the value they expect to 
achieve from it. These are intentionally expressed in common language. Keeping stories short is 
important because it ensures the requirements are fine-grained.
****

[.query-result]
== User Story #1
[.query.build]
--
I am a registered user +
I want to change my password +
to personalise it and better remember it
--

[.result.build]
....
As a registered user, 
I want to change my password, 
so I can to personalise it and better 
remember it.
....

[.cue]
****
Once defined all user-stories, a list of all functionalities should be stored in a document in form of table or 
just text. The product backlog could be modified during the project by removing elements, priority change, new
requirements, etc. For that, we need to keep this list accesible and in a framework that enables modifications 
easily.

== Product Backlog Priorization

Imagine that we have the followig list of stories complemented with the customer priorization. how
we can plan the development?

[.slide-title-top]
== Product Backlog Priorization (Solution)
image::priorization-sol.jpeg[Prioeization Exercise,1280,720,role=cover canvas]

[.cue]
****
Considering this list, we start to order from high priority to lowe one. If the priority is the same, we 
check the required time (lower time at maximun cost is priorised). 
****

[.slide-title-down]
== Sprint Backlog
image::sprint-backlog.jpeg[Sprint Backlog,1280,720,role=cover canvas]

[.cue]
****
The sprint backlog consist on a list of tasks derived from selecting high to lower functonalities from the 
product backlog. Thus, each functonality in the product backlog is splitted into specific tasks. Therefore, 
the sum of the time required for elaborated the task should be the same as the one determined in the 
product backlog.
****

[.slide-title-down]
== Sprint
image::sprint.png[Sprint,1280,720,role=cover canvas]

[.cue]
****
The sprints are the core part of SCRUM. The sprints refers to the development cicles (project iterations). 
Commonly, this iterations chould cover 1-4 weeks. Each sprint shold have a clear objective just to 
clarify the functional prototype to be delivered. An important thing is that the work performed inside an 
sprint do not change during their execution.  
****

[.slide-title-down]
== Increments
image::increment.gif[Increment,1280,720,role=cover canvas]

[.cue]
****
The increments corresponds with the result of each sprint. It is very important that at the end of the sprint
we deliver a functional product that will be enhanced during the sprints.

== Product Owner

****
The *Product Owner* is the authorised person to be the "voice" of the client inside the company. Their 
principal mission is to maximise the product value according to the client directives. 

Considering their role: 

- Responsible of the product backlog. 
- Discover the requirements and make petitions to the client to discover newer functionalities or resolve 
potential doubts. 
****

[.slide-title-down]
== Development Team
image::dev-team.jpeg[Development Team,1280,720,role=cover canvas]

[.cue]
****
The *Development Team* is the group of professionals in charge of producing the product. As mentioned previously,
principal features are:

- Multidisciplinary team. 
- Self-management teams. 
- High Communication and transparency.  
****

[.slide-title-down]
== Scrum Master
image::scrum-master.jpeg[Scrum Master,1280,720,role=cover canvas]

[.cue]
****
The *Scrum Master* is the responsible of ensuring the correct application of the methodology. Moreover, this
person actuates as a lider, ensuring the correct timing and product quality. Moreover, this person is in charge of
dealing with the problems abstracting the team for them.

[.slide-title-down]
== Sprint Planning 
image::sprint-planning.jpg[Sprint Planning,1280,720,role=cover canvas]

****
The *sprint planning meeting* is made at the begining of each sprint. This meeting requires for 1-2 h and the 
main objective is to evaluate, select and plan the coming weeks (entire sprint). 

In this meeting participates the entire developemnt team, the scrum master and the product owner. Thus, the 
product owner following the advices of the development team, is the one of selecting the functionalities and 
tasks to be included in each sprint. 
****

== Daily Meeting
image::daily-meeting.jpg[Daily Meeting,1280,720,role=cover canvas]

[.cue]
****
The *daily meeting* as the name says is a daily meeiting of 15-20 minutes. In this meetings only participates
the scrum master and the development team. In this meetings, only is considered the work to be performed 
inmediatly (same day) and the specific issues happened.
