<figure class="quote"><blockquote><p><strong>SCRUM</strong> is a technique to develop products with the objective of maximising product and project value.</p></blockquote><figcaption>SCRUM</figcaption></figure>
<aside role="note"><p>SCRUM definition refers to an agile technique to <strong>maximise the product and projetct value</strong>. SCRUM starts with
those aspects that we know or we have seen. After that, we adpat and track the progress as necessary
(Iterativelly).</p>
<p>Principal advantages of implementing SCRUM could be sumarising as:</p>
<ul><li><span class="primary"><strong>Decrement of the development time:</strong> Products that satisfies with most of the decided
functionalities and expetance.</span></li><li><span class="primary"><strong>Anytime a product could be launch</strong>: Functional prototypes will enable to launch a product at the end of
each sprint (project stage).</span></li><li><span class="primary"><strong>Agility and Flexibility:</strong> Adaptability to the newer requirements and demanded modifications.</span></li></ul></aside></section>
<section class="slide-title-down image" style="background-image: url(images/scrum-meth.jpeg); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat">
<aside role="note"><p>SCRUM methodology will start with the interviews between the customers and the product owner (client voice in
our company). Resulting from these interviews, the product owner elaborates an initial  <strong>Product Backlog</strong>.
The product backlog list of the main functionalities of the applicaiton that could change over time (sprints).
From product-backlog and in each sprint, the development team schedule the number of commits and functionalities
they will develop (<strong>sprint planning meeting</strong>). As a result from the sprint planning, the sprint backlog will stores
the numer of issues and the time required for elaborating them. At this moment, the sprint starts and the development
team is focused on performing the functional prototype. In this stage, the SCRUM master is the person in charge of
revising the work and ensuring correct developemnt times according to the plan. Each day of the sprint, the
<strong>daily scrum meetings</strong> ensures to avoid bottlenecks and problems during the development. These meetings corresponds
to small meetings where main problems and issues are discussed. At the end of the sprint, a <strong>review</strong> of the product
functionalities with the client is performed. In this meeting, the functionalities are validated and newer
requirements could appear. Finally, the development team and the scrum-master elaborates an <strong>sprint review</strong> just to
evaluate the sprint and how we could improve for the next one.</p>
<p>Within the next slides, we will enter in depth to this process describing the team members and roles, the artifacts
(documents to be elaborated), and the meetings to be performed.</p></aside></section>
<section class="slide-agenda-title"><h2>SCRUM Elements</h2></section>
<section class="slide-title-down image" style="background-image: url(images/product-backlog.jpeg); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat"><h2>Product Backlog</h2>
<aside role="note"><p>The main parts of the SCRUM technique is the product backlog which defines requirements
the application must meet in order to be successful. The product backlog contains a list of
requirements that are jointly prepared between the client and the product owner. Commonly, the requirements
are expressed in form of user stories.</p></aside></section>
<section class="slide-title-top image" style="background-image: url(images/user-story.jpeg); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat"><h2>User Stories</h2>
<aside role="note"><p>User stories (or just “stories”) are short statements identifying the type of person,
the functionality they need to perform in their own terms, and the value they expect to
achieve from it. These are intentionally expressed in common language. Keeping stories short is
important because it ensures the requirements are fine-grained.</p></aside></section>
<section class="query-result"><h2>User Story #1</h2><div class="query build"><p>I am a registered user<br>
I want to change my password<br>
to personalise it and better remember it</p></div>
<pre class="screen result build"><samp>As a registered user,
I want to change my password,
so I can to personalise it and better
remember it.</samp></pre>
<aside role="note"><p>Once defined all user-stories, a list of all functionalities should be stored in a document in form of table or
just text. The product backlog could be modified during the project by removing elements, priority change, new
requirements, etc. For that, we need to keep this list accesible and in a framework that enables modifications
easily.</p></aside></section>
<section class="slide-title-top image" style="background-image: url(images/priorization-ex.jpeg); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat"><h2>Product Backlog Priorization</h2>
<aside role="note"><p>Imagine that we have the followig list of stories complemented with the customer priorization. how
we can plan the development?</p></aside></section>
<section class="slide-title-top image" style="background-image: url(images/priorization-sol.jpeg); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat"><h2>Product Backlog Priorization (Solution)</h2>
<aside role="note"><p>Considering this list, we start to order from high priority to lowe one. If the priority is the same, we
check the required time (lower time at maximun cost is priorised).</p></aside></section>
<section class="slide-title-down image" style="background-image: url(images/sprint-backlog.jpeg); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat"><h2>Sprint Backlog</h2>
<aside role="note"><p>The sprint backlog consist on a list of tasks derived from selecting high to lower functonalities from the
product backlog. Thus, each functonality in the product backlog is splitted into specific tasks. Therefore,
the sum of the time required for elaborated the task should be the same as the one determined in the
product backlog.</p></aside></section>
<section class="slide-title-down image" style="background-image: url(images/sprint.png); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat"><h2>Sprint</h2>
<aside role="note"><p>The sprints are the core part of SCRUM. The sprints refers to the development cicles (project iterations).
Commonly, this iterations chould cover 1-4 weeks. Each sprint shold have a clear objective just to
clarify the functional prototype to be delivered. An important thing is that the work performed inside an
sprint do not change during their execution.</p></aside></section>
<section class="slide-title-down image" style="background-image: url(images/increment.gif); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat"><h2>Increments</h2>
<aside role="note"><p>The increments corresponds with the result of each sprint. It is very important that at the end of the sprint
we deliver a functional product that will be enhanced during the sprints.</p></aside></section>
